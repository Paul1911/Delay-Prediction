    "# Task Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Case description:\n",
    "Welcome to East Carmen Airlines! As a strategic data scientist, you are confronted with many use cases to digitalize the airline business. Most important for airlines are accurate predictions of flight arrivals during a day of operations. When it comes to passenger handling, such predictions would admit a proactive steering, in order that the passengers reach the connection flights and therefore save a lot of money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your model should be applicable to each aircraft in East Carmen’s fleet. Let us take as an example the aircraft with registration name EC-LPD. At scheduled departure of the earliest morning flight from East Carmen’s hub Madrid the model should predict all flights of EC-LPD on the given day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many business stakeholders do not trust in the robustness of such a model. They claim that for a given aircraft, one could predict the first flight of the day with a decent error, but the errors of second and third flights will be huge. It is now your task to convince the business stakeholders that with a well-prepared data set and meaningful features you can deliver robust flight predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Project Aim:\n",
    "From different departments business analysts have collected a lot of information on possible features for flight predictions. Now it is your task to use these data to deliver a prototype forecasting model for all flights of a given aircraft at scheduled departure of the first flight of the day. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, for an aircraft with registration name EC-LPD, first flight of the day (FFOD) scheduled at 5:30 am from MAD to VIE and with the connection chain MAD-VIE-MAD-CDG-MAD-LHR-MAD your model should predict the successive landing times in VIE, MAD, CDG, MAD, LHR, MAD. The colleagues from daily operations are especially interested in how the confidence level of such a model evolves during a day of operations."

    "- BI (=business intelligence) colleagues have collected a lot of flight information from many different de-partments: flight-, crew- and ground operations. Each department uses a different data warehouse. BI colleagues claim that some of the columns might be redundant and some information could be wrong, due to bad and not consistent data in the different data warehouses of the business departments. It is central for this prototype study to clean and transform the data and make consistency checks, before applying a machine learning algorithm."
